When you run the Tic Tac Toe AI code, this will create the AI brain and download it to your computer. 
You can then use the Tic Tac Toe Game program, where you will face off against the AI.
In this program, after you press play the program will output a number. This represents the space on the grid where the AI wants to go.
The grid spaces are numbered as follows:

 1  |  2  |  3\
\---------\
 4  |  5  |  6\
\---------\
 7  |  8  |  9

Once the AI makes a move, you will need to input this change into the GameBoard list in the Tic Tac Toe Game program by changing the "0" at the place in the list where the AI wants to go into a "1".
Once you choose the place you want to go, you will need to input this change into the GameBoard list by changing the "0" at the place in the list where you want to go into a "2".
If the previous two instructions are not followed, the AI simply will not work and will output "1" instead of a valid move in a space that is not taken.
